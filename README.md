# Togethr

Togethr is a collaborative event planing application to help hosts organize events. Hosts can assign items for guests to bring, and can also send split payment requests through Venmo. There is also a built in chat room feature for guests/hosts to talk about the upcoming event. Facebook is used for login and adding guests, however guests can also be manually added using their emails.
