# Beer and Chip

The intention of this app is to help people organize events together and they need to buy groceries or other things. We organize this by either telling the guests to bring specific things or charging them the splitted amount that they are supposed to bring.

We are extending our colleagues project with some extra functionallities that includes adding facebook friends, making the website easier to use and partially implementing Venmo API.
